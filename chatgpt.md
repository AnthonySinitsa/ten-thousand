Define a GameLogic class in ten_thousand/game_logic.py file.
Handle calculating score for dice roll
Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to rules of game.

      class GameLogic:
          @staticmethod
          def calculate_score(dice_roll):
              score = 0

              # Calculate score based on the rules of the game
              counts = [0] * 7  # Initialize a list to count the occurrences of each dice value

              for dice in dice_roll:
                  counts[dice] += 1

              # Check for scoring combinations
              if counts[1] >= 3:
                  score += 1000
                  counts[1] -= 3

              for i in range(2, 7):
                  if counts[i] >= 3:
                      score += i * 100
                      counts[i] -= 3

              score += counts[1] * 100  # Add remaining 1's
              score += counts[5] * 50  # Add remaining 5's

              return score

## for testing

once the main bulk of the code was done, we then wrote test driven code and asked gpt to help write code for this specific test and we did this for a handle full of tests

example:

Prompt: *insert code here

modify the code to work with this test:

    def test_five_of_a_kind():
        actual = GameLogic.calculate_score((2, 2, 2, 2, 2))
        expected = 600
        assert actual == expected

output:

    if counts[1] == 5:
      score += 3000 
      return score
